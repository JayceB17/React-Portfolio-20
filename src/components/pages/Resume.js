       I Have been working sence I was a teenager in high school.  My first job 
       I worked at a dairy farm where I worked for 4 years saving money for my 
       LDS Mission.  It was a good job for a kid where I learned how to work 
       hard.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When I got back from my 2 year mission I got a job woring for vivint where 
        I installed secrity systems for people at their homes.  I quickly learned it 
        was not for me so I started looking for a new job when the summer ended.

        I slowly got more and more responsabilty.  I learned how to drive a forklift, 
        and was incharge of safety trainning for my who team.
